change_form is used to customise the add/change form. Here it has been used to
add instructions for filling up the form.
1.Copy change_form.html from django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/
2.To customise for the entire site place in /admin/
3.To customise for an app place in /admin/app_name/
4.To customise for a specific model place in /admin/app_name/model_name

Important: To customise a template check its hierarchy in django/contrib/admin/templates/
Copy the template to be changed into the same folders/sub-folders and then edit.
Don't forget the admin sub-directory.

How It Works: First Django looks for the templates in your /templates/subdirectory.
If there are no templates in your project's template folder, then
by default, Django renders the templates in django.contrib.
