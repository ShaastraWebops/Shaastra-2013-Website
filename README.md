shaastra
=====================
6th June, 12
Basic Tabs done. 
Please take care of the different settings that need for dajax to run.
Dont use 'shaastra' as your project folder's name. Dajax was not accepting hyphens for some reason. My folder's name is 'shaastra'.
If you have a different name please change 'Dajaxice.shaastra.events.<some_func>' to 'Dajaxice.<your_project_folder>.events.<some_func>' in all the templates. 
Dont forget to add AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'events.UserProfile' to your local settings.
