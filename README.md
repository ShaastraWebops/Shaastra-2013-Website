Shaastra-2013-Website
=====================
6th June, 12
Basic Tabs done. 
Please take care of the different settings that need for dajax to run.
Dont use 'Shaastra-2013-Website' as your project folder's name. Dajax was not accepting hyphens for some reason. My folder's name is 'shaastra'.
If you have a different name please change 'Dajaxice.shaastra.events.<some_func>' to 'Dajaxice.<your_project_folder>.events.<some_func>' in all the templates. 
Dont forget to add AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'events.UserProfile' to your local settings.
